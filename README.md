A plugin to bring common keybinds for managing splits and tabs in vim.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as follows using some package manager like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) or any other of your choice:

```vim
call plug#begin()
Plug 'cherryramatisdev/windows.vim'
call plug#end()
```

> Bonus Tip: it's recommended to use the undoquit plugin for more power when managing splits: <https://github.com/AndrewRadev/undoquit.vim>

## Commands & Keybinds

- `<C-w>!` `:WindowTransformSplitIntoTab`: Transform the current split into a new tab and delete the split similar to the tmux bind
- `<C-w>t` `:WindowOpenCurrentSplitIntoTab`: Open the current split path into a new tab, **but keep the split opened on the previous tab**
- `<C-w>z` `:WindowZoom`: Toggle zoom stage for the current split
